# Robustness-of-MESC

This repository contains the codes of simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the method **mediated expression score regression (MESC)** (Yao, et al., 2020) for the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomethods/bpad024):

 - *Lin, C., Liu, W., Jiang, W. & Zhao, H. Robustness of quantifying mediating effects of genetically regulated expression on complex traits with mediated expression score regression. Biology Methods and Protocols 8(2023).* 

All code is available on Github: [https://github.com/leaffur/Robustness-of-MESC/]
