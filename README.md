# Robustness-of-MESC

This repository contains the code of simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the method **mediated expression score regression (MESC)** (Yao, et al., 2020) as part of the paper, "Robustness of quantifying mediating effects of genetically regulated expression on complex traits with mediated expression score regression" [https://doi.org/10.1093/biomethods/bpad024].

All code is available on Github: [https://github.com/leaffur/Robustness-of-MESC/](https://github.com/leaffur/Robustness-of-MESC/)
