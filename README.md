# Robustness-of-MESC

This repository contains the code of simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the method **mediated expression score regression (MESC)** (Yao, et al., 2020) as part of the manuscript "Robustness of quantifying mediating effects of genetically regulated expression on complex traits with mediated expression score regression".

All code is also available on Github: [https://github.com/powellgenomicslab/onek1k_phase1](https://github.com/leaffur/Robustness-of-MESC/)https://github.com/leaffur/Robustness-of-MESC/
